This page contains the event logs files I used to showcase the prototype I built during my research work.
All the evaluation results of the real case study are published as well as a spreadsheet in excel with interactive dashboards.
The event logs are generated after filtering them on by attribute "regular" cases and applying heuristic miner algorithm available in the ProM tool (http://www.promtools.org/doku.php?id=prom611).

The original data sets are published in this link: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:31a308ef-c844-48da-948c-305d167a0ec1
